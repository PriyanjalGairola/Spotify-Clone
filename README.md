# Spotify Clone

A responsive front‑end clone of **Spotify’s Web Player** crafted with **pure HTML5 and CSS3** (no JavaScript required). It recreates Spotify’s familiar layout—sidebar navigation, library section, image cards, and the fixed bottom music player—showcasing modern CSS techniques and clean semantics.
